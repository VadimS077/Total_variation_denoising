# Total Variation Denoising

This project is a Python implementation of the total variation denoising algorithm. The main.py file contains the code for adding noise to an image and then applying the total variation denoising algorithm to remove the noise. The test.jpg file is used as the input image for testing the denoising algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the main.py file. You will need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your machine to run this project.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed:

* Python
* OpenCV
* Numpy

`
pip install opencv-python  
pip install numpy  


### Installing

Clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies.


git clone https://github.com/VadimS077/Total_variation_denoisisng.git   
pip install opencv-python  
pip install numpy  
`

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system, simply run the main.py file. This will add noise to the test.jpg image and then apply the total variation denoising algorithm to remove the noise.


## Deployment

This project can be deployed on a live system by integrating it with a web application or any other platform where image denoising is required.
